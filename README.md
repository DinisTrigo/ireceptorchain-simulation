# Introduction

This repository contains the code developed for the article Agent-based Modelling and Simulation of a Blockchain Incentive System to Support Auditing of Traceability Data. It contains two scripts to reproduce each of the simulation trials on the article. After running, it produces a csv file with the results.

# Byzantine-fault tolerance trials

To run the byzantine-fault tolerance simulation trials, run script `run-byzantine-fault-tolerance-trials.sh`.

# Scalability trials

To run the scalability simulation trials, run script `run-scalability-trials.sh`.
